# triumf++

triumf++ is a collection of [C++] routines aimed at aiding the analysis of
condensed matter experiments ([μSR] and [β-NMR]) performed at [TRIUMF]'s [CMMS]
facility.

## Requirements

- [C++17] : Recent revision of the [C++] programming language.
- [Boost] : A set of high-quality, peer-reviewed, free and portable [C++] libraries.
- [ROOT] : An open-source data analysis framework used by high energy physics and others.
